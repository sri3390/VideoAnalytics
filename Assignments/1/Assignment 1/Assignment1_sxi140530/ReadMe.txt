Code Submitted:

Part1.java - java file for the 1st question of assignment i.e increase brightness of image.

Part2.java - java file for 2nd question of the assignment i.e convert each of the above 4 images to hsv from rgb band.

Part3.java - java file for the 3rd question of the assignment i.e detect the oranges in the 8 images generated before.

To run the code make sure opencv libraries are linked to the environment.

The images are saved in the project directory from where the code is run.

Brigtness1.png - image with +10 brightness.
Brigtness2.png - image with +50 brightness.
Brigtness3.png - image with +100 brightness.

hsv1.png - hsv of original image.
hsv2.png - hsv of brightness1.png.
hsv3.png - hsv of brightness2.png.
hsv4.png - hsv of brightness3.png.

fruitimagedetect.png - detect orange of the original image.
Brightness1detect.png - detect orange of the Brightness1.png image.
Brightness1detect.png - detect orange of the Brightness1.png image.
Brightness2detect.png - detect orange of the Brightness2.png image.
Brightness3detect.png - detect orange of the Brightness3.png image.

hsv1detect.png - detect orange of the hsv1.png image.
hsv2detect.png - detect orange of the hsv2.png image.
hsv3detect.png - detect orange of the hsv3.png image.
hsv4detect.png - detect orange of the hsv4.png image.

Please run Part1.java followed by Part2.java followed by Part3.java.
